# cryptoanalyzer
The program for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar cipher algorithm

The program requests the path to the file whose text needs to be encrypted/decrypted
It also requests the path to the file where the encrypted/decrypted text should be placed.

The program can:
1) Encrypt information from a file using a key.
2) Decrypt information from a file using a key.
3) Decrypt information from a file without a key by hack the file using the BruteForce.
4) Decrypt information from a file without a key by hack the file using the statistical text analysis.
